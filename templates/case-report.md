# Case Report Writing Guide

## Structure (CARE-compliant)

Case reports follow a different structure from IMRAD. Write in this order:

### 1. Patient Information
- Demographics (age, sex, relevant background)
- Chief complaint / reason for consultation
- Relevant medical history
- Relevant family history (if applicable)

### 2. Clinical Findings
- Physical examination findings
- Relevant vital signs
- Key positive AND negative findings

### 3. Timeline
- Chronological sequence of events
- Dates of key milestones (presentation, diagnosis, treatment start, follow-up)
- Consider a timeline figure

### 4. Diagnostic Assessment
- Working diagnosis / differential diagnoses
- Key diagnostic tests and results
- Reasoning process for final diagnosis

### 5. Therapeutic Intervention
- Treatment(s) administered, including dosing
- Changes in treatment and reasons
- Adverse events and management

### 6. Follow-up and Outcomes
- Clinician-assessed outcomes
- Patient-reported outcomes (if available)
- Adherence and tolerability
- Long-term follow-up plan

## Rules

- Write the case in chronological order
- Include ONLY clinically relevant details
- Protect patient privacy (no identifiable information without consent)
- Document informed consent for publication
- Report BOTH positive and negative findings
- Use past tense for the patient's course
- Every diagnostic test mentioned must have a result reported
- Reference the CARE checklist (`references/reporting-guidelines.md`)

## CARE Checklist Quick Reference

These items MUST be present in your case report:
- [ ] Title contains "case report"

- [ ] Informed consent for publication documented
- [ ] Timeline clearly presented
- [ ] Diagnostic reasoning explained
- [ ] All relevant investigations reported with results

- [ ] Follow-up duration and outcomes stated
- [ ] Limitations of the case discussed

## Common Mistakes

- Including irrelevant clinical details
- Missing informed consent statement
- No timeline or unclear chronology
- Omitting negative findings
- Not explaining diagnostic reasoning
- Missing follow-up outcomes
- Forgetting to discuss why this case is reportable
