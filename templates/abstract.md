# Abstract Writing Guide

## Structure (Structured Abstract)

| Section | Content | Sentences |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Background/Objective** | Why this study? What was the aim? | 1-2 |
| **Methods** | Study design, population, main methods | 2-3 |
| **Results** | Key findings with numbers | 3-4 |
| **Conclusions** | Main message (mirrors full Conclusion) | 1-2 |

## Rules

- Write LAST (after all other sections are complete)
- Must be self-contained (reader should understand without reading full paper)
- All numbers must match the full text exactly
- No references
- No abbreviations without definition (except universally known ones)
- Stay within word limit (typically 250-350 words; check journal)
- Use past tense for methods and results

## Quality Checklist

| Check | Pass? |
|-------|-------|
| Word count within journal limit? | |
| All numbers match full text? | |
| No undefined abbreviations? | |
| Conclusion matches full Conclusion section? | |
| Study design clearly stated? | |
| Primary outcome reported with statistics? | |
| Self-contained (understandable alone)? | |

## Tips

- Many readers (and reviewers) read ONLY the Abstract
- PubMed displays only the Abstract
- This is your paper's "elevator pitch"
- Spend extra time polishing it
