# Introduction Section Writing Guide

## Structure: 3 Paragraphs (Funnel Shape)

### Paragraph 1: General Background
- Start broad: a fact everyone in the field agrees with
- Establish the importance of the topic
- Cite 2-4 key background references

Example pattern:
> "{Disease/Topic} is a significant {clinical problem / public health concern} affecting {population}. {Treatment/Approach} has been established as {standard/effective/common}..."

### Paragraph 2: Knowledge Gap (Clinical Question)
- Narrow the focus: what is NOT known
- Review what prior studies have shown
- Identify the specific gap your study addresses
- Use transition words: "However,", "Nevertheless,", "Although... it remains unclear..."

Example pattern:
> "However, the relationship between {Factor X} and {Outcome Y} remains unclear. Previous studies have reported {conflicting results / limited evidence}..."

### Paragraph 3: Study Objective
- State the purpose of YOUR study clearly
- Use standard phrasing: "The aim/purpose/objective of this study was to..."
- This paragraph MUST mirror the Conclusion

Example pattern:
> "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether {Factor X} is an independent predictor of {Outcome Y} in patients undergoing {Treatment Z}."

## Rules

- Write Paragraph 3 FIRST (with Conclusion), then Paragraphs 1-2 later
- Keep it concise: 3 paragraphs, rarely more
- Every statement should be supported by a reference (except for universally accepted facts)
- Do not include your own results
- Do not over-review the literature (save detailed comparison for Discussion)
- Use present tense for established knowledge, past tense for specific studies

## Common Mistakes

- Too long (reviewing everything ever written on the topic)
- Missing clear statement of study objective
- Objective does not match Conclusion
- No clear gap identified (why is this study needed?)
