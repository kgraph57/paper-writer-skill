# Highlights, Key Points, and Summary Boxes

> Many medical journals require structured summaries beyond the abstract. These help readers quickly assess relevance.

---

## 1. Key Points (JAMA Style)

Required for all JAMA original investigations, research letters, and reviews.

```
KEY POINTS

Question: [One sentence framing the research question]

Findings: [One sentence with the key quantitative result(s)]

Meaning: [One sentence about the clinical or scientific implication]
```

**Example:**
```
KEY POINTS

Question: Does early physical therapy reduce chronic pain after lumbar surgery?

Findings: In this randomized clinical trial of 340 patients, early physical
therapy (starting within 48 hours) reduced chronic pain at 6 months compared
with standard care (32% vs 51%; P = .003).

Meaning: Initiating physical therapy within 48 hours of lumbar surgery may
substantially reduce the risk of chronic postoperative pain.

## 2. What Is Known / What This Study Adds (BMJ Style)

Required by BMJ, BMJ specialty journals, and many other journals.

```
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
- [Bullet point 1: established fact]
- [Bullet point 2: established fact]
- [Bullet point 3: the gap or uncertainty]

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
- [Bullet point 1: new finding]
- [Bullet point 2: new finding]
- [Bullet point 3: implication or next step]
```

**Rules:**
- 2-3 bullet points per box
- No data or statistics — conceptual statements only
- First box should make clear WHY this study was needed
- Second box should make clear WHAT changes because of this study

- [Statement 1 — max 85 characters including spaces]
- [Statement 2 — max 85 characters including spaces]
- [Statement 3 — max 85 characters including spaces]
- [Statement 4 — max 85 characters including spaces]
- [Statement 5 — max 85 characters including spaces]
```

**Rules:**

## 4. Clinical Significance Statement

Used by various specialty journals.

```
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
- [What clinicians should know from this study]
- [How it might change practice]
- [Key number or finding to remember]
```

---

## 5. Significance Statement (PNAS Style)

```
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT (max 120 words)

[A paragraph written for a broad scientific audience explaining
why this work matters. Avoid jargon. Focus on the impact and
implications rather than the technical details.]
```

---

## 6. Lay Summary / Plain Language Summary

Increasingly required by journals (eLife, PLOS Medicine, some Lancet journals, EU clinical trials regulation).

```
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY (150-300 words)

[Write for a general audience with no medical training.
Use active voice, short sentences, and no jargon.

Structure suggestion:]

THE KNOWN:
[What was already known about this topic — 1-2 sentences]

THE NEW:
[What this study found — 2-3 sentences]

THE IMPLICATIONS:
[Why this matters for patients or society — 1-2 sentences]
```

**Rules:**
- Reading level: 8th grade / age 13-14
- No abbreviations (spell out everything)
- No statistics (use "about half" instead of "48.3%")
- No references
- Active voice only
