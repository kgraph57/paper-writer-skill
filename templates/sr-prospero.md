## 26. Strategy for Data Synthesis **(required)**

**Field:** Describe how data will be synthesized.

**Tips:**
- Describe both narrative and quantitative approaches
- Specify meta-analysis model and software
- Define heterogeneity thresholds
- Describe subgroup and sensitivity analyses

**Example:**
> Studies will be grouped by outcome and synthesized narratively, describing direction and magnitude of effects.
>
> Where three or more studies report the same outcome with sufficient homogeneity, random-effects meta-analysis will be performed using the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimator in R (meta package, version 7.0). Heterogeneity will be assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q test (significance at p < 0.10). Prediction intervals will be calculated.
>
> Pre-specified subgroup analyses: (1) AI model type, (2) clinician review vs. no review, (3) disease type, (4) study design.
>
> Sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding high risk of bias studies, (2) excluding studies with imputed data.
>
> Publication bias will be assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test when ≥10 studies are pooled.
>
> Certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach.
