# Results Section Writing Guide

## Structure

Write Results in this order (matching Methods):

### 1. Study Population / Patient Characteristics
- Flow of participants (enrolled, excluded, analyzed)
- Demographics table reference (e.g., "Table 1 shows baseline characteristics")
- Key numbers: total N, groups, follow-up duration

### 2. Primary Outcome
- Present main result clearly
- Include effect size, confidence interval, p-value
- Reference the relevant Table/Figure

### 3. Secondary Outcomes
- Present in the same order as listed in Methods
- Each with appropriate statistics

### 4. Subgroup / Sensitivity Analyses
- If pre-specified in Methods
- Present with appropriate caution

## Rules

- **Facts only**: no interpretation, no opinion, no comparison with other studies
- **No references**: do not cite other papers in Results
- **Mention every Table/Figure** in the text at least once
- **Correspond 1:1 with Methods**: every method has a result, every result has a method
- Use past tense
- Report exact numbers (not "many" or "most")
- Include: N, percentages, means/medians, SD/IQR, p-values, CIs

## Formatting

- Refer to tables as "Table 1" (not "the following table")
- Refer to figures as "Figure 1" or "Fig. 1" (check journal style)
- Present numbers consistently (same decimal places)
- Use SI units

## Common Mistakes

- Adding interpretation ("interestingly", "surprisingly", "as expected")
- Citing references
- Missing Table/Figure references in text
- Inconsistent numbers between text and tables
- Results that have no corresponding method
