# Case Report Abstract Writing Guide

## Structure (CARE-compliant)

Case report abstracts differ from research article abstracts. Use this structure:

### Background (1-2 sentences)
- Why is this case worth reporting?
- What gap does it fill or what rarity does it illustrate?

### Case Presentation (3-5 sentences)
- Patient demographics (age, sex)
- Chief complaint and key history
- Key clinical findings
- Diagnostic workup and diagnosis
- Treatment and outcome

### Conclusions (1-2 sentences)
- Clinical lesson or take-home message
- Implications for practice

## Word Limit

- Typically 150-250 words (check target journal)
- Shorter than research article abstracts

## Rules

- Do NOT use Methods/Results structure for case reports
- Include the final diagnosis in the abstract
- State the clinical significance clearly
- Match all facts with the full case description
- No references in the abstract

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Background states why the case is reportable
- [ ] Patient demographics included
- [ ] Diagnosis clearly stated
- [ ] Treatment and outcome summarized
- [ ] Clinical lesson stated in conclusion
- [ ] Word count within journal limit
- [ ] All facts match the full text
- [ ] No abbreviations without definition (unless universally known)
