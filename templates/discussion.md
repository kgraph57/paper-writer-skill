# Discussion Section Writing Guide

## Structure

### Paragraph 1: Summary of Main Findings
- Restate the key results (briefly, not repeating all numbers)
- Connect to the study objective
- "In this study, we found that..."

### Paragraphs 2 to N-1: Comparison with Literature
- Compare your findings with previous studies
- Use the literature matrix to structure comparisons
- For each key finding:
  1. State your result
  2. Compare with prior studies (agree or disagree?)
  3. Offer possible explanations for differences
  4. Support with references

Pattern:
> "Our finding that {X} is consistent with {Author et al.}, who reported {Y}. However, {Other Author et al.} found {Z}, which may be explained by differences in {population / methodology / definitions}..."

### Paragraph N: Limitations
- Be honest and specific
- Common limitations to address:
  - Study design (retrospective, single-center)
  - Sample size
  - Selection bias
  - Confounders not measured
  - Generalizability
- Do NOT apologize; state limitations factually

### Final Paragraph: Implications and Future Directions
- Clinical implications of your findings
- What should clinicians consider?
- What future studies are needed?
- Keep speculation minimal and clearly labeled

## Rules

- No new results (all results belong in Results section)
- No excessive speculation or "leap of logic"
- Every claim must be supported by data or references
- Keep it focused (Discussion is often too long)
- Do not repeat the Introduction background
- Do not overstate the significance of your findings

## Common Mistakes

- Too long (readers lose interest)
- Speculating beyond what the data supports
- Hiding or minimizing limitations (reviewers will catch this)
- Repeating Results section verbatim
- Not comparing with existing literature
- Making therapeutic recommendations not supported by the study design
