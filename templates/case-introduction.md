# Case Report Introduction Writing Guide

## Structure: 2-3 Short Paragraphs

Case report introductions are shorter and structured differently from research articles.

### Paragraph 1: Background
- Brief description of the disease/condition
- Current understanding (1-3 sentences)
- Cite 2-3 key references

### Paragraph 2: Why This Case Is Reportable
- What makes this case novel, rare, or instructive?
- Common reasons:
  - Rare disease or unusual presentation
  - New treatment approach or unexpected response
  - Diagnostic challenge or pitfall
  - Important clinical lesson
- This is NOT a "knowledge gap" paragraph (unlike research articles)
- This is a "this case is worth reading because..." paragraph

### Paragraph 3 (optional): Case Report Objective
- If needed, state what the reader will learn
- "We report a case of... to highlight..."

## Rules

- Keep it SHORT (typically 200-400 words)
- Do not over-review the literature (save comparisons for Discussion)
- Clearly state why the case deserves publication
- Do not reveal the outcome in the Introduction
- Write the Introduction AFTER the Case section (you need to know the case to justify its reporting)

## Difference from Research Article Introduction

| Research Article | Case Report |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Background → Gap → Objective | Background → Why Reportable → (Optional Objective) |
| 3 paragraphs, funnel shape | 2-3 short paragraphs |
| Justifies a study | Justifies reporting a case |
| "We investigated whether..." | "We report a case of... to highlight..." |

## Common Mistakes

- Too long (copying the research article model)
- Not clearly stating why the case is reportable
- Revealing the diagnosis or outcome too early
- Excessive literature review
