# Limitations Section Writing Guide

> Every medical paper needs a Limitations section. It demonstrates scientific rigor and helps readers interpret findings correctly. Reviewers consistently check this section.

## Where to Place Limitations

| Paper Type | Placement | Typical Length |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Original Article | Within Discussion (usually penultimate paragraph) | 1-2 paragraphs |
| Systematic Review | Within Discussion (dedicated subsection) | 2 subsections: "Limitations of the evidence" + "Limitations of the review" |
| Case Report | Within Discussion (1 paragraph) | 3-5 sentences |
| Review Article | Within Discussion (penultimate paragraph) | 1 paragraph |
| Letter | Final paragraph (1-2 sentences) | 1-2 sentences |

## Categories of Limitations

### 1. Study Design Limitations

| Limitation | How to Write It | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Retrospective design | "The retrospective nature of this study limits our ability to establish causality." | Observational studies |
| Single-center | "As a single-center study, generalizability to other settings may be limited." | Hospital-based studies |
| Cross-sectional | "The cross-sectional design precludes assessment of temporal relationships." | Survey studies |
| No control group | "The absence of a control group limits causal inference." | Before-after studies |
| Open-label | "The open-label design may have introduced performance and detection bias." | RCTs without blinding |

### 2. Population / Sample Limitations

| Limitation | How to Write It |
|-----------|----------------|
| Small sample size | "The sample size of N patients may have limited statistical power to detect smaller but clinically meaningful differences." |
| Selection bias | "Patients were recruited from a tertiary referral center, which may limit generalizability to primary care settings." |
| Lack of diversity | "The study population was predominantly [demographic], limiting applicability to other populations." |
| High attrition | "Loss to follow-up of X% may have introduced attrition bias." |

### 3. Data / Measurement Limitations

| Limitation | How to Write It |
|-----------|----------------|
| Self-reported data | "Reliance on self-reported data may have introduced recall bias." |
| Missing data | "Missing data for [variable] (X%) were handled using multiple imputation, but the results may be influenced by unmeasured confounding." |
| No validated instrument | "The [outcome measure] has not been validated in [this population]." |
| Unmeasured confounders | "We could not adjust for [confounder] as this was not captured in the dataset." |
| Short follow-up | "The [N]-month follow-up period may not capture long-term outcomes." |

### 4. Analysis Limitations

| Limitation | How to Write It |
|-----------|----------------|
| Multiple comparisons | "Multiple comparisons increase the risk of type I error; findings from secondary analyses should be interpreted with caution." |
| Post-hoc analysis | "The subgroup analysis was exploratory and should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating." |
| Confounding | "Despite multivariable adjustment, residual confounding cannot be excluded." |

## Writing Principles

### DO:
1. **Be specific** — name the exact limitation, don't use vague language
2. **Explain the direction of bias** — does the limitation overestimate or underestimate the effect?
3. **Describe mitigation** — what did you do to minimize the impact?
4. **Acknowledge honestly** — reviewers respect transparency
5. **Connect to strengths** — balance limitations with study strengths

### DO NOT:
1. ~~"This study has several limitations"~~ → Name them specifically
2. ~~Minimize real weaknesses~~ → Be candid
3. ~~List strengths as limitations~~ → "A limitation is that we had a large sample" is NOT a limitation
4. ~~Use limitation as excuse~~ → Present, explain impact, and describe mitigation
5. ~~Overstate limitations~~ → Don't undermine your own findings unnecessarily

## Template: Limitations Paragraph

```
This study has [number] main limitations. First, [limitation 1 — specific description].
This may have [direction of bias — overestimated/underestimated the effect / limited generalizability].
However, [mitigation strategy or context]. Second, [limitation 2]. [Impact and mitigation].
[Third, if applicable]. Despite these limitations, [transition to strengths or final interpretation].
```

## Template: Strengths and Limitations (Full Subsection)

For papers where the journal requires a dedicated "Strengths and Limitations" subsection:

```
### Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. [Strength 1 — e.g., large sample, multicenter, validated outcomes].
[Strength 2 — e.g., long follow-up, robust statistical methods, diverse population].

However, several limitations should be considered. First, [limitation with direction of bias].
[Mitigation]. Second, [limitation]. [Mitigation]. Third, [limitation].

These limitations should be weighed against the strengths of [key strength] when
interpreting our findings.
```

## Systematic Review: Two-Part Limitations

PRISMA 2020 requires BOTH types of limitations:

```
### Limitations

#### Limitations of the Included Evidence
- [Quality of included studies — e.g., "Most studies were rated as high risk of bias
  due to lack of blinding"]
- [Heterogeneity — e.g., "Substantial clinical heterogeneity across studies limited
  the pooled estimate"]
- [Reporting — e.g., "Several studies did not report ITT analyses"]

#### Limitations of the Review Process
- [Search — e.g., "We searched only English-language databases, potentially missing
  relevant studies in other languages"]
- [Selection — e.g., "Grey literature was not systematically searched"]
- [Analysis — e.g., "Meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity in
  outcome definitions"]

## 日本語テンプレート

```
### 本研究の限界

本研究にはいくつかの限界がある。第一に、[限界1の具体的記述]。このため、
[バイアスの方向性]の可能性がある。ただし、[緩和策]。第二に、[限界2]。
[影響と緩和策]。これらの限界はあるものの、[強みへの接続]。
