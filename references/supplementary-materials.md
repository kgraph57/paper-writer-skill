# Supplementary Materials Strategy Guide

## Overview

Supplementary materials (appendices, online-only content) let you provide full detail without exceeding the main manuscript's word/page limits. Strategic use of supplements strengthens the paper.

## What Goes in Supplementary vs. Main Text

### Keep in Main Text

- Primary results (the main finding)
- Key tables (Table 1 baseline, main outcome table)
- Key figures (primary endpoint figure, CONSORT/PRISMA flow)
- Essential methods details
- Core statistical analyses

### Move to Supplementary

- Full search strategies (systematic reviews)
- Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses
- Extended regression models (e.g., multiple adjustment levels)
- Detailed protocol descriptions
- Raw data or additional data tables
- Risk of bias detailed assessments
- PRISMA/CONSORT/STROBE checklists (completed)
- Additional figures supporting secondary outcomes
- Patient questionnaires or data collection instruments
- Statistical code
- Extended literature review tables

## Decision Framework

```
Is this information required to understand the main finding?
|
+-- YES --> Main text
|
+-- NO --> Would a reviewer want to see this?
    |
    +-- YES --> Supplementary materials
    |
    +-- NO --> Do not include
```

## Formatting Guidelines

1. Number supplements sequentially (Table S1, Figure S1, Appendix A)
2. Every supplement must be cited in the main text
3. Use the same formatting style as the main manuscript
4. Include a header on each supplement page: "Supplementary Materials for: [Paper Title]"
5. Provide page numbers across all supplement pages
6. Include a supplement table of contents if > 5 items

## Naming Convention

```
Supplementary_Table_S1_baseline_extended.docx
Supplementary_Figure_S1_subgroup_forest.tiff
Supplementary_Appendix_A_search_strategy.docx
Supplementary_Methods_statistical_code.R
```

## Word Limit Strategies

When the main text exceeds the journal's word limit:

1. Move detailed methods to a supplementary methods section
   - Keep a brief version in the main text with "see Supplementary Methods for details"
2. Move secondary outcome results to supplementary tables/figures
3. Move sensitivity/subgroup analyses entirely to supplements
4. Consolidate discussion paragraphs (prioritize primary findings)
5. Move extended literature comparisons to a supplementary table

What NOT to move to supplements:
- The primary result
- The main conclusion
- Essential context in the Introduction
- The study objective
- Ethics/consent statements

## Supplement Checklist

- [ ] Every supplement is cited at least once in the main text
- [ ] Supplement numbering is sequential and consistent
- [ ] Supplements are self-explanatory (include captions and legends)
- [ ] No essential information is only in supplements
- [ ] Format matches journal requirements
- [ ] File size within journal limits
- [ ] Supplements do not contradict main text
