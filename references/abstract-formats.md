## Key Rules Across All Journals

1. **Numbers must match the main text exactly** — cross-check every statistic
2. **No references in abstract** (except some basic science journals)
3. **No abbreviations** on first use — spell out (some journals ban all abbreviations in abstract)
4. **Include exact P values** and confidence intervals where possible
5. **State sample size** in Results or Methods
6. **No speculation** — only state what the data show
7. **Clinical trial registration** number required for interventional studies
8. **Funding source** required by some journals (Lancet, Annals)

## 日本語抄録

### 日本語ジャーナルの抄録形式

多くの日本語医学ジャーナルは構造化抄録を採用：

```
【目的】[1-2文]
【方法】[2-3文]
【結果】[3-4文、主要な数値を含む]
【結論】[1-2文]
```

### 英文ジャーナルへの投稿時
- 抄録は英語で作成
- 日本語抄録が別途必要な場合あり（二重投稿チェック用）
- 日本語の固有名詞はローマ字表記
