# Journal Selection Decision Framework

## Overview

Selecting the right journal is one of the most consequential decisions in the publication process. A poor choice wastes months in review cycles. This guide provides a systematic framework for evaluating and selecting target journals, with a focus on medical AI and digital health.

## Decision Criteria Matrix

Use this matrix to score candidate journals on a 1-5 scale for each criterion. The weights can be adjusted based on your priorities.

| Criterion | Weight | Description | How to Evaluate |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Scope Fit** | 5 (Critical) | Does the journal publish papers like yours? | Read last 12 months of TOC, check aims & scope |
| **Impact Factor (IF)** | 3 | Journal prestige and citation metrics | Check JCR, Scopus, or journal website |
| **Acceptance Rate** | 3 | Probability of acceptance | Check journal website, ask colleagues, estimate from submission volume |
| **Time to Decision** | 4 | First decision turnaround | Check journal website, ScholarOne stats, ask colleagues |
| **Open Access Options** | 2 | OA availability (full OA, hybrid, green) | Check journal OA policy page |
| **APC Cost** | 2 | Article Processing Charge for OA | Check journal website; typical range $2,000-$5,000 |
| **Readership/Audience** | 4 | Will your target audience read this journal? | Consider who needs to see your work |
| **Indexing** | 3 | PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science indexed? | Check NCBI, Scopus source list |
| **Reputation in Field** | 3 | How peers view the journal | Ask mentors, check conference citation patterns |
| **Page/Word Limits** | 1 | Does your paper fit the format? | Check author guidelines |

## Journal Tier Strategy

### The Cascade Approach

Always prepare a submission cascade before your first submission. This prevents wasted time deciding where to go after a rejection.

```
Tier 1 (Reach)         →  Rejection  →  Tier 2 (Target)
   ↓                                        ↓
 Accept!                                  Rejection  →  Tier 3 (Safety)
                                                          ↓
                                                        Accept!
```

**Planning Rules:**
1. **Tier 1 (Reach):** 1-2 journals above your expected level. Worth trying if the paper is strong. Budget 2-4 months.
2. **Tier 2 (Target):** 2-3 journals that regularly publish similar work. This is where you realistically expect to land.
3. **Tier 3 (Safety):** 1-2 journals with higher acceptance rates. Your paper should fit comfortably here.
4. **Never submit to more than one journal simultaneously** (this is considered misconduct).
5. **Reformat efficiently.** Choose journals within the same publisher family when possible (e.g., Nature → Nature Medicine → npj Digital Medicine all use similar formats).

### Timing Considerations

| Journal Tier | Typical First Decision | Full Review Cycle |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Top tier (Nature, NEJM, Lancet) | 1-2 weeks (desk reject) or 2-4 months | 6-12 months |
| High tier (specialty flagships) | 2-4 weeks | 3-6 months |
| Mid tier | 4-8 weeks | 3-5 months |
| Lower tier / rapid review | 2-4 weeks | 1-3 months |

**Tip:** If you have a career deadline (graduation, promotion, grant renewal), work backward from the deadline and choose your cascade accordingly.

## How to Check Journal Scope

### Step 1: Read the Aims & Scope Statement

Every journal has an "Aims & Scope" or "About" page. Look for:
- Specific topics listed as in scope
- Types of articles accepted (original research, reviews, case reports, etc.)
- Methodological preferences (RCTs only? Observational OK? Computational?)
- Geographic or disease-area focus

### Step 2: Review the Recent Table of Contents

Browse the last 6-12 months of published articles:
- Are there papers with similar methods to yours?
- Is the target population similar?
- Are AI/ML papers included (for medical AI work)?
- What is the typical study design?

### Step 3: Check the Editorial Board

- Do board members have expertise in your area?
- Are there AI/informatics experts (for medical AI papers)?
- Is there geographic diversity?

### Step 4: Search for Similar Papers

Use PubMed or Google Scholar:
```
site:[journal-url] "your key methodology" OR "your key topic"
```

If you find 3+ similar papers published in the last 2 years, the journal is likely a good fit.

### Step 5: Use Journal Finder Tools

- **Elsevier Journal Finder:** https://journalfinder.elsevier.com/
- **Springer Journal Suggester:** https://journalsuggester.springer.com/
- **Wiley Journal Finder:** https://journalfinder.wiley.com/
- **JANE (Journal/Author Name Estimator):** https://jane.biosemantics.org/

## Red Flags for Predatory Journals

### Warning Signs

| Red Flag | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Unsolicited email invitations | "Dear esteemed researcher, please submit your excellent work..." |
| Extremely rapid review | "Guaranteed acceptance within 7 days" |
| No clear editorial board | Board members cannot be verified, or are unrelated to the field |
| No clear peer review process | Vague or absent description of review procedures |
| Journal name mimics a legitimate journal | "International Journal of..." with slight spelling variations |
| No rejection rate mentioned or implied 100% acceptance | Legitimate journals reject substantial portions of submissions |
| APC demanded before review | Legitimate OA journals charge after acceptance, not before |
| Poor website quality | Grammatical errors, broken links, no ISSN |
| Not indexed in major databases | Not in PubMed, Scopus, or Web of Science |
| Scope is impossibly broad | "We accept papers from all fields of science and engineering" |

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Check Beall's List:** https://beallslist.net/ (list of potential predatory publishers)
- [ ] **Check DOAJ:** https://doaj.org/ (Directory of Open Access Journals -- legitimate OA journals are listed here)
- [ ] **Check PubMed indexing:** Search the journal name in NLM Catalog (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog)
- [ ] **Check JCR / Scopus:** Does the journal have an Impact Factor or CiteScore?
- [ ] **Check COPE membership:** https://publicationethics.org/ (Committee on Publication Ethics)
- [ ] **Ask your mentor or librarian** -- they often know which journals to avoid
