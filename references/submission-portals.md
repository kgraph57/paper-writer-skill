## Portal-Specific Tips

### ScholarOne
- Abstract: paste as plain text (no formatting)
- Figures: upload individually with labels (Fig 1, Fig 2, etc.)
- Author order: drag and drop to reorder
- COI forms: upload as "Other" file type
- Status tracking: Dashboard shows "Under Review", "Decision in Process", etc.

### Editorial Manager
- "Build PDF" step: system generates a merged PDF for review
- Author must APPROVE the built PDF before submission is complete
- Companion files vs. manuscript files distinction
- Detailed status emails at each step

### eJournalPress (JAMA)
- JAMA has its own unique interface
- Requires structured Key Points during submission
- Statistical code may need to be uploaded
- Very strict format requirements

## Common Submission Errors to Avoid

1. **Incomplete author information** — missing ORCID, wrong affiliation order
2. **Figure quality too low** — must meet DPI requirements
3. **Abstract exceeds word limit** — portal may reject
4. **Missing COI forms** — need one per author, signed
5. **Wrong file format** — .doc vs .docx, TIFF vs JPEG
6. **Forgetting to approve built PDF** (Editorial Manager)
7. **Not including reporting checklist** — many journals require this
8. **Title page in main manuscript** (for blinded journals) — must be separate

## Pre-Submission Inquiry

Some high-impact journals accept pre-submission inquiries:

| Journal | Accepts Pre-Inquiry | Method |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| NEJM | Yes (encouraged) | Online form or email |
| The Lancet | Yes | Email to editorial office |
| BMJ | No | Direct submission |

A pre-submission inquiry typically includes:
