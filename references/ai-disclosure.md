# AI Tool Disclosure Guide for Academic Manuscripts

## Overview

Since the ICMJE updated its recommendations in 2023, most major journals require disclosure of AI tool usage in manuscript preparation. This guide covers when, where, and how to disclose AI assistance.

---

## ICMJE Position (2023-)

> "Authors should disclose the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies (such as Large Language Models [LLMs], chatbots, or image creators) in the production of submitted work. Authors should note that AI cannot be listed as an author because it cannot be responsible for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of the work."

Key points:
- AI cannot be an author (fails ICMJE criterion 3 and 4: final approval and accountability)
- Authors remain fully responsible for all AI-generated content
- Disclosure must specify which tool was used and how

## What Requires Disclosure

| Activity | Disclosure Required? | Where |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Literature search using AI | Yes | Methods |
| Drafting text with AI | Yes | Methods + Acknowledgments |
| AI-assisted data analysis | Yes | Methods |
| AI-generated figures | Yes | Methods + Figure legend |
| Grammar/language editing by AI | Journal-dependent | Acknowledgments |
| AI-assisted translation | Yes | Acknowledgments |
| Using AI for code generation (statistical scripts) | Yes | Methods |
| Reference formatting by AI | Usually no | - |

## Disclosure Templates

### For Methods Section

#### When AI assisted with drafting

```
Artificial intelligence tools were used during the preparation of this
manuscript. Specifically, [Tool name, version/model] ([Company name])
was used for [specific tasks: e.g., literature organization, initial
draft generation, language editing]. The authors reviewed, edited, and
take full responsibility for all content. All data, analyses, and
interpretations were performed and verified by the authors.
```

#### When AI assisted with data analysis

```
[Tool name] was used to assist with [specific analysis: e.g., natural
language processing of clinical notes, image classification]. The
AI-generated results were independently verified by [author initials]
using [verification method].
```

#### When AI assisted with literature search

```
An AI-assisted search was conducted using [Tool name] to supplement
systematic database searches. All AI-identified references were manually
verified for existence and relevance by the authors (see Citation
Verification, Supplementary Appendix X).
```

### For Acknowledgments Section

```
The authors acknowledge the use of [Tool name, version] ([Company name])
for [specific purpose: language editing / translation assistance /
manuscript formatting]. The authors reviewed and edited all AI-generated
output and take full responsibility for the content of this manuscript.
```

### Combined Template (Comprehensive)

```
AI-Assisted Technology Disclosure: [Tool name and version] was used
during the preparation of this work for [list all uses]. The authors
reviewed and edited all output as needed and take full responsibility
for the content of this publication.
```

## Journal-Specific Requirements

### Journals requiring separate AI disclosure statement

| Journal / Publisher | Requirement | Location |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| Nature portfolio | Separate disclosure in Methods | Methods section |
| Science | Must disclose in Acknowledgments | Acknowledgments |
| The Lancet | Disclosure in Methods or Acknowledgments | Either |
| JAMA Network | Disclosure in Methods | Methods section |
| BMJ | Disclosure in Methods | Methods section |
| Elsevier journals | Structured AI statement | Dedicated section |
| Wiley journals | Disclosure in Acknowledgments | Acknowledgments |
| PLOS | Disclosure in Methods | Methods section |
| Springer Nature | Separate AI disclosure | Methods section |

### Elsevier Structured Format

Elsevier requires a dedicated section titled "Declaration of Generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process":

```
During the preparation of this work the author(s) used [AI tool name]
in order to [reason]. After using this tool/service, the author(s)
reviewed and edited the content as needed and take(s) full responsibility
for the content of the publication.
```

## What NOT to Do

1. Do not list AI as an author -- AI cannot meet ICMJE criteria
2. Do not hide AI usage -- non-disclosure may be considered research misconduct
3. Do not claim AI-generated text as entirely your own without disclosure
4. Do not submit AI output without human review -- you are responsible for accuracy
5. Do not use AI to fabricate data -- this is research fraud regardless of the tool
6. Do not assume AI output is correct -- verify all facts, citations, and statistics

---

## Responsibilities After Disclosure

Even with proper disclosure, authors must:

- [ ] Verify all factual claims made by AI
- [ ] Verify all citations (see references/citation-verification.md)
- [ ] Verify all statistics and data
- [ ] Ensure no plagiarism in AI-generated text
- [ ] Ensure no fabricated content
- [ ] Take full responsibility for the final manuscript
- [ ] Be prepared to explain and defend all content during peer review

---

## Template for This Skill (Paper Writer)

When using this paper-writer skill, include the following disclosure (adapt as needed):

### English

```
During the preparation of this manuscript, the authors used Claude
(Anthropic) as an AI writing assistant for [literature organization /
draft structuring / language editing / citation formatting]. All
scientific content, data analysis, and interpretations were performed
by the authors. The authors reviewed, edited, and verified all
AI-assisted output and take full responsibility for the content of
this publication.
```

### Japanese

```
本論文の作成にあたり、著者らはAIライティングアシスタント（Claude,
Anthropic社）を[文献整理 / 構成の検討 / 言語編集 / 引用書式の整理]の
目的で使用した。全ての科学的内容、データ解析、および解釈は著者らが
実施した。AI支援による出力は著者らが確認・編集・検証しており、本論文の
内容について全責任を負う。
```
