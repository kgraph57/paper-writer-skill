## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|---------|
| Forgot to register before enrollment | Register immediately; explain in cover letter; some journals accept with justification |
| Outcomes differ from registration | Document and justify all changes; report both registered and actual outcomes |
| Multiple registrations | Cross-reference all IDs; designate one as primary |
| Results posting required | ClinicalTrials.gov requires results within 12 months of completion (US law) |
| Registration expired/outdated | Update registration before submission |
