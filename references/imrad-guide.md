## Full Paper Structure (Reading Order)

```
Title
Abstract
Keywords
Introduction
Methods
Results
Discussion
Conclusion
Acknowledgments
References
Supplementary Materials
```

## Recommended WRITING Order

```
1. Methods & Results        ← Write as a pair
2. Introduction (end) & Conclusion  ← Write as a pair
3. Discussion
4. Introduction (beginning)
5. Abstract
6. Title                    ← Write LAST
```

**Why this order?** You build from the most objective (data) to the most subjective (interpretation). The pairs ensure internal consistency.

## Section Relationships

```
Introduction paragraph 3 (objective)
         ↕ MUST MATCH
Conclusion (answer to objective)

Methods section X
         ↕ 1:1 CORRESPONDENCE
Results section X

Discussion claims
         ↕ SUPPORTED BY
Results data + Literature references
```

## Length Guidelines (Original Article)

| Section | Typical Length | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Title | 10-15 words | Varies by journal |
| Abstract | 250-350 words | Check journal limit |
| Introduction | 400-600 words | 3 paragraphs |
| Methods | 600-1000 words | Be thorough |
| Results | 600-1000 words | Match Methods scope |
| Discussion | 800-1500 words | Focused, not exhaustive |
| Conclusion | 50-100 words | 1-2 sentences |

## Tense Usage

| Section | Tense | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Introduction (known facts) | Present | "Diabetes mellitus is..." |
| Introduction (specific studies) | Past | "Smith et al. reported..." |
| Methods | Past | "We included patients who..." |
| Results | Past | "The mean age was..." |
| Discussion (your results) | Past | "We found that..." |
| Discussion (general truth) | Present | "These findings suggest..." |
| Conclusion | Past/Present | "X was associated with Y" |

## Voice

- **Preferred**: Active voice ("We analyzed...") in most modern journals
- **Acceptable**: Passive voice ("Data were analyzed...") in some journals
- **Check journal style**: some still prefer passive

## Common IMRAD Violations to Avoid

1. Results in Methods ("We found the data showed...")
2. Interpretation in Results ("Surprisingly, the rate was high")
3. References in Results (compare in Discussion, not Results)
4. New results in Discussion (all results go in Results)
5. Methods not described for a result presented
6. Conclusion that does not match Introduction objective
