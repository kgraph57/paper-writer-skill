# Desk Rejection Prevention Guide

> 40-70% of submissions to top journals are desk-rejected (rejected without peer review). Understanding common reasons allows authors to avoid preventable rejections.

## Top Reasons for Desk Rejection

### 1. Scope Mismatch (Most Common)
- Paper topic does not fit the journal's aims and scope
- **Prevention**: Read 10 recent articles in the journal; check aims and scope page

### 2. Insufficient Novelty
- Findings are incremental or already well-established
- **Prevention**: Clearly state what is NEW in the cover letter and introduction
- **Red flags**: "This is the first study in our country to..." (geographic novelty alone is weak)

### 3. Poor Study Design
- Sample size too small for the research question
- Inappropriate statistical methods
- No control group when one was feasible
- **Prevention**: Consult a statistician before data collection

### 4. Manuscript Quality
- Poor English/language
- Disorganized structure
- Missing required sections
- **Prevention**: Professional editing; follow journal template exactly

### 5. Ethical Issues
- No ethics approval documented
- No informed consent
- Missing trial registration
- **Prevention**: Include IRB/ethics committee name and approval number

### 6. Formatting Non-Compliance
- Wrong reference style
- Exceeds word/figure limits
- Missing required elements (cover letter, checklists)
- **Prevention**: Use the journal's template; check submission guidelines thoroughly

### 7. Incomplete Submission
- Missing author information or ORCID
- Missing COI forms
- Missing reporting checklist
- **Prevention**: Use the pre-submission checklist before uploading

### 8. Plagiarism/Duplicate Publication
- High similarity score on iThenticate/Turnitin
- Previously published data without proper citation
- **Prevention**: Run similarity check before submission; cite your own prior work

## Pre-Submission Self-Check

### Scope and Impact

- [ ] Have I read at least 10 recent papers from this journal?
- [ ] Does my topic match the journal's stated aims and scope?
- [ ] Is the novelty clearly articulated?
- [ ] Would this journal's readers be interested?
- [ ] Is the impact sufficient for this journal's tier?

### Design and Methods

- [ ] Is the study design appropriate for the research question?
- [ ] Is the sample size justified (power calculation for RCTs)?
- [ ] Are the statistical methods appropriate?
- [ ] Does the design match a reporting guideline (CONSORT, STROBE, etc.)?

### Manuscript Quality

- [ ] Has the manuscript been proofread by a native/fluent speaker?
- [ ] Is the structure clear (IMRAD for originals, CARE for case reports)?
- [ ] Are all sections present as required by the journal?
- [ ] Is the writing concise (no unnecessary repetition)?

### Ethics and Compliance

- [ ] Ethics approval stated (committee name + approval number)?
- [ ] Informed consent documented?
- [ ] Clinical trial registered (if applicable)?
- [ ] Data availability statement included?
- [ ] AI use disclosed (if applicable)?

### Formatting

- [ ] Word count within limits (abstract AND main text)?
- [ ] Reference format matches journal style?
- [ ] Figure/table count within limits?
- [ ] Required reporting checklist completed?
- [ ] Cover letter addresses the editor specifically?

## Journal Selection Strategy

### Choosing the Right Journal

1. **Start with scope** — Does the journal publish papers on this topic?
2. **Check recent issues** — Is your paper type published there?
3. **Assess impact** — Is your study significant enough for this tier?
4. **Consider turnaround** — What is the average time to first decision?
5. **Check OA requirements** — Does your funder mandate OA?

### Journal Tier Strategy

| Strategy | Description | Risk |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Aim high, cascade down** | Submit to highest-impact journal first | Time: 3-6 months lost per rejection |
| **Best fit first** | Submit to the best-matched journal | Lower risk, faster publication |
| **Hybrid** | Try 1 reach journal, then best fit | Balance of ambition and efficiency |

### Useful Resources

- **Journal Finder tools**: Elsevier Journal Finder, Springer Journal Suggester, Wiley Journal Finder
- **Think. Check. Submit.** (https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) — verify journal legitimacy
- **Beall's List** — check for predatory journals

## After Desk Rejection

### What to Do

1. **Read the rejection reason carefully** — editors often give specific feedback
2. **DO NOT argue** with desk rejection (almost never overturned)
3. **Assess whether to revise** before resubmitting elsewhere:
   - If "scope mismatch": submit elsewhere without changes
   - If "insufficient novelty": strengthen the cover letter's novelty statement
   - If "quality issues": revise the manuscript
4. **Reformat for the next journal** immediately (see journal-reformatting.md)
5. **Update the cover letter** for the new journal
6. **Submit within 1-2 weeks** — momentum matters

### Turnaround Times (Approximate)

| Journal | Desk Decision | Peer Review | Total to First Decision |
|---------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| NEJM | 1-2 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| JAMA | 1-2 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 6-8 weeks |
| Lancet | 1-2 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 6-8 weeks |
| BMJ | 1-2 weeks | 3-5 weeks | 4-7 weeks |
| PLOS ONE | 1 week | 4-8 weeks | 5-9 weeks |

## Cover Letter Tips to Avoid Desk Rejection

2. **State novelty in the first paragraph**
3. **Explain why THIS journal** (not generic praise)
4. **Mention the reporting guideline followed**
5. **Confirm all ethical requirements met**
6. **Suggest appropriate reviewers** (if the journal allows)
7. **Keep it to one page**
