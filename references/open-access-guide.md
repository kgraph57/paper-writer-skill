# Open Access Publishing Guide

> Understanding OA models, APCs, preprint policies, and funder mandates is essential for modern medical publishing.

## Open Access Models

| Model | Description | APC | Examples |
|-------|------------|-----|---------|
| **Gold OA** | Published OA in a fully OA journal | Yes ($1,000–$11,000+) | PLOS Medicine, BMJ Open, eLife |
| **Hybrid OA** | OA article in a subscription journal | Yes (often higher) | Lancet (hybrid option), NEJM (no OA option) |
| **Diamond/Platinum OA** | Fully OA, no APC | No | Some society journals, JMIR journals |
| **Green OA** | Self-archiving (preprint/postprint) | No | Via institutional repository or preprint server |
| **Bronze OA** | Free to read on publisher site, no license | No | Publisher discretion, may not be permanent |

## Typical APCs by Journal Tier

| Journal | APC (USD, approx.) | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Nature Medicine | $11,390 | Gold OA option |
| The Lancet | $6,300 | Hybrid OA |
| BMJ | $4,500 | Fully OA since 2023 for research |
| PLOS ONE | $1,931 | Gold OA |
| BMJ Open | $2,100 | Gold OA |
| eLife | $2,000 | Diamond (no APC since 2023, "publish then review") |
| JMIR | $1,950–$2,750 | Gold OA |
| Cureus | $0 | Diamond OA |

**Note**: APCs change frequently. Always verify on the journal website before submission.

## Creative Commons Licenses

| License | Allows | Restricts | Use Case |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **CC BY 4.0** | Any use with attribution | Nothing | Most funder-compliant, RECOMMENDED |
| **CC BY-NC 4.0** | Non-commercial use | Commercial use | Common for hybrid OA |
| **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** | Non-commercial, no derivatives | Commercial use + modifications | Most restrictive OA |
| **CC0** | Anything, no attribution needed | Nothing | Data sharing |

**Funder requirements**: NIH, Wellcome Trust, UKRI, and most European funders require CC BY 4.0.

## Preprint Servers

| Server | Field | DOI | Journal Policy |
|--------|-------|-----|---------------|
| **medRxiv** | Medicine/health | Yes | Most journals accept (check SHERPA/RoMEO) |
| **bioRxiv** | Biology/biomedicine | Yes | Widely accepted |
| **arXiv** | Physics/math/CS/quantitative biology | Yes | Accepted by most journals |
| **SSRN** | Social sciences/health economics | Yes | Elsevier-affiliated |
| **Preprints.org** | Multidisciplinary | Yes | MDPI-affiliated |
| **J-STAGE Preprints** | Japan-focused | Yes | Growing adoption |

### Preprint Best Practices

1. **Before posting**: Check target journal's preprint policy (SHERPA/RoMEO database)
2. **Journals that DO NOT accept preprints**: NEJM (changed 2023 — now accepts), some Elsevier journals (check individually)
3. **Journals that WELCOME preprints**: BMJ, PLOS, eLife, Nature journals, Lancet journals
4. **After acceptance**: Update preprint with link to published version
5. **DOI**: Preprint DOI is separate from published DOI — both remain valid

## Funder OA Mandates

| Funder | Mandate | Required License | Embargo |
|--------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **NIH** (US) | PMC deposit within 12 months | CC BY preferred | 12 months max |
| **Wellcome Trust** (UK) | Immediate OA | CC BY 4.0 | None (immediate) |
| **UKRI** (UK) | Immediate OA since April 2022 | CC BY 4.0 | None |
| **Plan S / cOAlition S** (EU) | Immediate OA | CC BY 4.0 | None |
| **AMED** (Japan) | Encouraged, not mandated | — | — |
| **JSPS** (Japan) | Encouraged via institutional repos | — | — |

### Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Funder identified and mandate checked
- [ ] Journal's OA option verified
- [ ] License compatible with funder requirement
- [ ] APC budget confirmed (or waiver applied for)
- [ ] PMC/Europe PMC deposit planned (if required)
- [ ] Institutional repository deposit planned (Green OA backup)

## APC Waivers and Discounts

Many publishers offer APC waivers for:
- Authors from low-income countries (World Bank classification)
- Unfunded research
- Society members (partial discount)
- Institutional agreements (Read & Publish deals — check with your library)

**How to apply**: Usually during submission or at acceptance. Apply BEFORE acceptance if possible.

## 日本語

### オープンアクセスの選択

- 日本の科研費ではOAは推奨されているが義務ではない（2026年現在）
- 機関リポジトリ（Green OA）は多くの大学で整備済み
- APCは研究費から支出可能（直接経費）
- CC BY 4.0が国際的な標準ライセンス
- J-STAGEは多くの日本語ジャーナルのプラットフォーム
- medRxivへのプレプリント投稿は日本からも増加中
