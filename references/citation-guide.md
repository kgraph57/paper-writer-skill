## AI Citation Verification

When AI assists with references, ALWAYS verify:
1. Does the paper exist? (Search by DOI or title on PubMed)
2. Are the authors correct?
3. Is the journal name correct?
4. Are volume, issue, and pages correct?
5. Does the cited content match what the paper actually says?

AI frequently fabricates plausible-sounding citations. Treat every AI-suggested reference as unverified until confirmed.
