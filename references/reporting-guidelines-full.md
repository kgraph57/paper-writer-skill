## GRADE (Certainty of Evidence)

Used in systematic reviews and clinical guidelines.

| Level | Definition | Criteria |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **High** | Very confident the true effect is close to the estimate | Well-conducted RCTs, no serious limitations |
| **Moderate** | Moderately confident; true effect likely close to estimate | RCTs with some limitations; well-conducted observational |
| **Low** | Limited confidence; true effect may differ | Observational studies; RCTs with serious limitations |
| **Very low** | Very little confidence | Serious limitations, inconsistency, imprecision |

### Factors That Lower Certainty
1. Risk of bias
2. Inconsistency (heterogeneity)
3. Indirectness
4. Imprecision
5. Publication bias

### Factors That Raise Certainty (Observational)
1. Large effect size
2. Dose-response gradient
3. All plausible confounding would reduce the effect
